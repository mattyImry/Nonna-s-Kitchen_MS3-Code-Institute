# **_Nonna's Kitchen_**

This project is my third Milestone Project for the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Fullstack Web Developer Diploma. This project is created to demonstate my ability to design and implement back-end functionality with the use of [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/). Data is stored in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) a document-base database. I will be following the CRUD principles Create, Read, Update and Delete. With this priciples I can allow the User to store and manipulate his recipes in the database.
The deployed application can be accessed here "ADD LINK"  

## **_UX_**  
### **_Strategy / Site Owner story_**

I have design this website to allow the User to create and save recipes. Without registering the casual User can only view other Users' recipes. If the User decides to register will be able to create, store, modify and delete his own recipes, basically creating his own recipe book. There will be also an Admin functionality only for maintenance purposes. I have also created this app so as the Developer I can collect other's Users recipes and try them myself. The main type of recipes created by the Developer will be Italian but any other type of cusine is welcome.

### **_Scope_**

Features that I want to implement are:

*  CRUD operations to allow Users to interact with the application.  
*  Ability for the Users to register an account.
*  Ability to search recipes.
*  Ability to contact the Developer with EmailJs functionality.
*  Easy design and navigation.
*  Mobile first design.

### **_Structure_**

* The recipes will be categorised and stored in three main courses type: first course, main course and dessert.  
 
* A list of all recipes stored in the website will be shown to all the Users in the main page. 

* The Users will be able to view all the recipes that they have created via "My profile" page.
 

### **_Skeleton_**

* The recipes will be presented with all the informations needed for the preparation on a card style format for easy navigation. 

* To add the recipes to the app a minimalistic style form will be use.  

* A search function will be present for all the Users, logged in or not, in the main page to search the recipes database.

* The Users can use the Navigation bar to navigate the different pages withing the website.

* A contact page link will always be present in the footer.

* The logo and "Home" link in the Navigation bar will redirect the Users to the main page.
